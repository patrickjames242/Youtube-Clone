# Youtube-Clone

<p>
    This is a YouTube clone that allows you to search for and watch YouTube videos with a UI that mimics the actual YouTube website. The website was CUSTOM BUILT FROM SCRATCH using vanilla Javascript.
</p>
<p>
    This website uses Javascript Modules, so it MUST be run using a server of some kind, such as Visual Studio Code's Live Server. Otherwise it will not work.
